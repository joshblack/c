Learning C 
==========

My collection of notes on C, including write-ups, programs, and additional resources.

# Table of Contents
- Variables
- [Data Types](topics/data-types.md)
- [Strings](topics/strings.md)
- [Arrays](topics/arrays.md)
- [Scope](topics/scope.md)
- [Functions](topics/functions.md)
- [Pointers](topics/pointers.md)
- [Dynamic Memory Allocation](topics/dynamic-memory.md)
- [Program Examples](c-programs)

## TODO

- [ ] Create Table of Contents to link to various parts of c-notes.md instead of having one huge file
- [ ] Update all program examples to link to their appropriate c file in c-programs
